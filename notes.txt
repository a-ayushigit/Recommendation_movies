**Difference between API View and Generic View**

In Django, there are two methods for creating and implementing views for a web application: APIView and generic views. Python functions that take a web request and return a web response are known as views.

The degree of abstraction between APIView and generic views is the primary distinction. A low-level, class-based view called APIView offers a more detailed and flexible method of designing views. This gives developers total control over the handling of requests and the generation of responses.

Generic views, on the other hand, are higher-level views that offer more generic and reusable building blocks for typical web application functionality. As a result, typical functionality like lists, detail views, and forms may be quickly implemented by developers without having to create a tonne of boilerplate code.

In general, the unique requirements and project objectives will determine whether to use APIView or generic views in a Django project. Generic views may be more suitable for easier or more standardised projects, whereas APIView may be more appropriate for complicated or specialised applications.


** *args and  **kwargs in python functions **

*args - variable number of non keyword  arguments are passes in the python function as a tuple 


def adder(*num):
    sum = 0
    
    for n in num:
        sum = sum + n

    print("Sum:",sum)

adder(3,5)
adder(4,5,6,7)
adder(1,2,3,5,6)

**kwargs - variable number of keyword arguments are passed in the python function 

def intro(**data):
    print("\nData type of argument:",type(data))

    for key, value in data.items():
        print("{} is {}".format(key,value))

intro(Firstname="Sita", Lastname="Sharma", Age=22, Phone=1234567890)
intro(Firstname="John", Lastname="Wood", Email="johnwood@nomail.com", Country="Wakanda", Age=25, Phone=9876543210)
